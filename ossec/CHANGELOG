OSSEC changelog (2.9.0) <scott@atomicorp.com>


Whats New
    Alert Output support for JSON and ZeroMQ
    Syscheck improvements
    Report file deletion, even without realtime enabled
    Report modifications made on directories
    Corrects bug so that files created between the first and second scan are reported as new files
    Corrects bug that made changes reverting a file to the state it was in when ossec started unreported
    Avoids computing hashes multiple times to improve performance
    Make the time between two syscheck wakeups configurable in internal_options
    Add support for the “nodiff” option when using report_changes, sensitive files tagged with in ossec.conf will not have their contents included in an alert.
    IPv6 support
    Support to call an external mailer. This solves the problem of supporting encryption when sending mail alerts in OSSEC. The <smtp_server> field can now be prepended with “/” to designate a local binary. Example: “<smtp_server>/usr/sbin/sendmail -t</smtp_server>”.
    Slack notification support
